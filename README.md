# Challenge-03-Password-Generator
The third challenge of this bootcamp was to create a functioning password generator using the provided base code.

# What was the project about?
This project involved a random password generator. When prompted, the user is able to decide then selectwhat types of characters they wold like to use in their password,
ranging from password length, to letter type, special characters, and numbers. After selcting all of the desired options, a random password will appear in the text box
on screen.

# How do I operate it?
To begin, select the 'Generate Password' button. They will first be prompted to pick a password length, or how many characters they would like there to be. From there,
the user will select each option using the options 'OK' for yes and 'Cancel' for no. For example, if you would like lowercase letters, you would select the 'OK' button.
Similarly, if the user would NOT like to use special characters, they would selct the 'Cancel' button. After selecting from each prompt, a randomly generated password
will appear onscreen containing a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.

# What was the purpose of this bootcamp?
This is the third challenge in this bootcamp, and was used to demonstrate the understanding of the different elements of JavaScript we have learned so far. While this
was a little tricky to figure out, it was exciting to see my code come across in the browser correctly after I was able to find and correct my errors.
